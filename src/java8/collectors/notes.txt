The Collectors class is a utility class in Java that provides methods for reducing and collecting
elements from a Stream into various data structures like List, Set, Map, etc.

Why Do We Need the Collectors Class?
    - Converting Stream elements into Collections (List, Set, Map, etc.)
    - Grouping and Partitioning data
    - Performing aggregation operations like sum, average, and joining strings
    - Creating immutable collections
